"""Knowledge-base kind discriminators.

A KB entry's ``type`` field tells the rest of the system how to treat it.
Most KBs are the default *indexed* kind (chunk → embed → retrieve via an RAG
provider) and carry no ``type``. *Connected* KBs are pointers: their content
lives outside ``data/knowledge_bases`` and we never copy or re-index it. Two
flavours exist today:

* ``obsidian`` — a pointer (``vault_path``) to a folder of Markdown the user
  owns. No index at all; the Obsidian capability navigates the live files and
  the chat loop routes the KB to that capability instead of ``rag``.
* ``linked`` — a pointer (``external_path``) to a folder that already holds an
  engine index the user built elsewhere (LlamaIndex / GraphRAG / LightRAG).
  Retrieval reads that index in place — the indexing step is skipped, and the
  KB is queried by its bound ``rag_provider`` exactly like an ordinary KB.

Both flavours share the same lifecycle quirks: no on-disk folder under
``base_dir``, no embedding reconcile, and deletion must never touch the
external files. The :func:`is_connected_kb` / :func:`external_root_of` helpers
let the manager treat them uniformly without sprinkling ``type`` literals
across the codebase.

Kept in its own low-level module so both :mod:`deeptutor.knowledge.manager`
and the capability layer can import it without a cycle.
